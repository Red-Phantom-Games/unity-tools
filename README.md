# unity-tools
A collection of small tools for Unity development

Currently contains the following:

- Scene Select Dropdown: A scene selection window that is compact enough to sit uninstrusively into your Unity editor layout).
- Clipboard To Asset Names: Allows for rapid naming of assets by copy-pasting strings from Windows clipboard.

Each tool is self-contained (by folder in the project - see folders in Scripts/Editor) so you can just grab what you need rather than the whole project.

More tools will be added as and when I create anything useful for public release.
